# Shell Scripting

## Exercise 1 - Count Chars

Script that counts the number of characters inside a file. The character & the file must be given as an argument.
usage : exercise1.sh L myfile  -> L is present X times

## Exercise 2 - Fibonacci
Script that displays the Fibonacci sequence of the given argument
usage: exercise2-v1.sh 5 -> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5

## Exercise 3 - Count Chars 2
Same as 1 but this script should accept either file input or standard input.
usage : cat myfile | exercise3.sh => result; Or exercise3.sh myfile => same result

## Exercise 4 - Get 2 things
Script that asks for your favorite color and animal. If the user say elephant or pink, the software should say “You win with pink and elephant”, if not, the output should be <color> and <animal> are great but don’t win this time

## Comments
